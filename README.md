# ShortestPath

Shortest path problem of an undirected graph from all nodes by Elixir and other languages

## Problem statement

Given is an undirected graph with *N* vertices and *M* edges.
Vertices are in *xy*-plain. 
The *i*-th vertice *Vi* has a position *(Xi, Yi)* for visualization of the graph.
The *j*-th edge is connected between *Vaj* and *Vbj* has a weight of *Wj*.
Find the shortest path between all vertices.

## Constraints

$$ 2 \leq N $$

$$ 1 \leq M \leq \frac{1}{2}N(N-1)$$

$$ 1 \leq i, a, b \leq N$$

$$ 1 \leq j \leq M$$

$$ 1 \leq Wj \leq 1000 $$

## Input

Input is given the file in `test/support/in` in the following format:

```
N M
X1 Y1
...
XN YN
Va1 Vb1 W1
...
VaM VbM WM
```

You can use `ShortestPath.InputReader.read/1` for obtaining *N*, *M*, the list of the lists `[Vaj, Vbj, Wj]` from the file.

## Output

Output the distance *Da,b* of the shortest path between the vertice *Va* and *Vb* for all vertices in the following format, for reducing amount of output:

```
N
D1,2 D1,3 ... D1,N
D2,3 D2,4 ... D2,N
...
DN-1,N
```

You can use `ShortestPath.OutputWriter.puts/1` for outputing in the above format.

## Sample inputs

See the directory `test/support/in`.

## Sample outputs

See the directory `test/support/out`.

## Usage

### Run benchmarks

```
mix run -r bench/shortest_path_bench.exs
```

If `ips` and `average` are `0.50` and `2.00s`, respectively, it means time out of the execution. 

```
##### With input N,M = 1000,499500 #####
Name                     ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
Dijkstra.MainA          0.50         2.00 s     Â±0.02%         2.00 s         2.00 s
```

### Generate an input case

```elixir
iex> :rand.seed(:exsss)
iex> ShortestPath.InputCaseGenerator.generate("sample_01.txt", 4, 6) # file_name, n, m
```

You'll get `test/support/in/sample_01.txt`.
